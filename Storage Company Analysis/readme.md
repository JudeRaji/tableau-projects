# About the Dataset:

This dataset was from a Real-World Company that wanted to visualize their storage locations on a map in a dashboard.
Data provided was an excel file containing a table with only three columns:
1.	Storage type
2.	UK Area code, and
3.	[Number of] Listings.

The company wanted Area/City Full Names instead of their Codes. Therefore, in order to get the full area code names, I had to do some data scraping.

## Other Requirements:
1.	Total listings per location and what percentage of the total listings that is.
2.	Visual for Same locations and storage type.
3.	Visual for just storage type by itself.
